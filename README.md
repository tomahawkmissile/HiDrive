# HiDrive
High power smart DC/DC switching converter

**Note: this is a conceptual project in its alpha stages.**

Planned features:
- Wide VIN (TBD)
- Buck-boost topology with configurable output voltage (output TBD)
- Max current (TBD)
- Full telemetry of voltages, currents, temperatures, and overall system health
- UVLO
- Overvoltage Shutoff
- Reverse polarity protection and indicator
- Integrated microcontroller with external bus support (CAN)
- Integrated TFT display
